# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
I create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I used moment js to keep track of the date and hours. Hours change color depending on the difference between current time and the time on the schedule. The events put into the schedule remain where the user typed them when the website is refreshed. You can enter in and edit the tasks by clicking on the associated box of the time you want the task to be.
